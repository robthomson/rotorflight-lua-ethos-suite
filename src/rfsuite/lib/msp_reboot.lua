-- Message-builder for MSP_REBOOT (cmd 68, write-only) --
-- app/pages/configuration.lua triggers this once its own EEPROM write
-- commits, since a PID loop speed change only takes effect after the FC
-- restarts (matching rotorflight-lua-ethos-suite's own
-- app/lib/ui.lua:rebootFc(), which does the same right after its own
-- save's EEPROM_WRITE completes).
--
-- Confirmed directly against rotorflight-firmware's own wire handler
-- (src/main/msp/msp.c, MSP_REBOOT case): an optional 1-byte reboot mode,
-- defaulting to MSP_REBOOT_FIRMWARE (0) when the payload is empty --
-- this always sends that byte explicitly, matching
-- rotorflight-lua-ethos-suite's own REBOOT.lua buildWritePayload(),
-- which does the same rather than relying on the empty-payload default.
--
-- **No armed-state safety check in this module** -- deliberately kept a
-- plain, stateless message-builder like every other lib/msp_*.lua codec
-- (no session/business-state reads). rotorflight-lua-ethos-suite's own
-- REBOOT.lua *does* gate this at the API layer (`validateWrite()`,
-- blocking the write while `resolveArmedState()` says armed) --
-- firmware's own MSP_REBOOT handler has no such guard at all (confirmed
-- reading the same wire handler above: it validates the reboot *mode*
-- byte, nothing about arm state), so that Lua-side check is the only
-- safety net that exists for this command, on either project. This
-- rebuild ports the same gate, just one layer up: app/page_runtime.lua's
-- own reboot-after-save flow (see its own comment) checks
-- `tasks/session.lua`'s `isArmed` before ever building this message, not
-- this file.

-- Self-caches via package.loaded (same mechanism lib/bus.lua uses) --
-- app/pages/configuration.lua reloads fresh via loadfile() on every
-- open, so without caching this was rebuilt on every navigation too. See
-- lib/msp_pid_tuning.lua's own comment for the full reasoning (added
-- after a live memory investigation, see AGENTS.md's "Memory stats
-- printing" section).

-- Builds a ready-to-publish write message. `onWritten()` (optional) is

-- restarts -- callers shouldn't expect a live connection right after
-- this); `onError(reason)` on failure/disconnect before that ack arrives.
--
-- maxRetries = 0 (send exactly once, no resend at all) rather than
-- tasks/msp/queue.lua's generic default (5) -- or even a single resend.
-- A lost ack here is the *expected* outcome, not a communication failure --
-- the FC accepts this command and immediately starts resetting, so its
-- reply routinely never makes it out before the link drops. The queue
-- can't tell that apart from a genuine timeout, so with the generic
-- default it would keep resending this same REBOOT command for up to 5
-- attempts -- and any resend that lands after the FC has already come
-- back up and reconnected commands *another* reboot. This used to cap at
-- maxRetries = 1 (one resend, two attempts total), on the theory that the
-- FC's own reboot+reconnect cycle would always be slower than one retry
-- window -- but a live "FBL keeps rebooting" report kept recurring after
-- applying telemetry sensor changes (see app/pages/telemetry.lua's
-- rebootAfterSave, though the mechanism is shared by every such page)
-- specifically, which chains two extra MSP writes (FEATURE_CONFIG,
-- TELEMETRY_CONFIG) plus the EEPROM_WRITE before this ever gets queued --
-- ample time for retryCount to have already ticked up on some earlier
-- message in that chain, and for the FC to reboot+reconnect well inside
-- the ~0.8s retry window once REBOOT is finally sent. REBOOT is not a
-- normal idempotent read/write -- resending it is never actually safe, so
-- the only correct retry count for it is zero: fire once, and treat a
-- missing ack as the expected case (the FC is, correctly, no longer there
-- to reply), not as a reason to try again.
