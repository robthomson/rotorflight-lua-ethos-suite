-- Look up a telemetry sensor's live value by logical name + transport
-- protocol, trying a short list of candidate appIds in order (some
-- ESCs/FCs/firmware versions broadcast the same logical value on a
-- different appId). Stateless -- no module-level state, just a lookup
-- table and pure functions -- the same category of neutral utility as
-- lib/mspcodec.lua.
--
-- Candidate appIds copied from rotorflight-lua-ethos-suite's
-- tasks/scheduler/telemetry/sources/{sport,crsf}.lua, trimmed to only the
-- sensors this rebuild currently needs (voltage, consumption, the
-- firmware-mirrored smartfuel channel, PID/rate/battery profile index,
-- and arm-status flags -- see lib/smartfuel_calc.lua and
-- tasks/session.lua). Add more entries here as more of the original's
-- ~30-sensor table is actually needed; don't port the rest speculatively.
--
-- Self-caught bug: `smartfuel` originally pointed at appId 0x5FE1 for both
-- protocols -- that's actually lib/diy_sensor.lua's own SMARTFUEL_APP_ID,
-- the address the *app itself* fabricates a sensor at when running the
-- local fallback (tasks/session.lua's smartfuelMode == 0 branch), not
-- where the FC's own firmware-computed value is broadcast. Looking that
-- appId up here to decide whether to mirror the firmware is circular --
-- nothing ever broadcasts there natively, so it always resolved to nil and
-- silently disabled fuel% (and the DIY sensor, which only gets created in
-- the *other* branch) whenever smartfuelMode > 0. Corrected to the real
-- firmware-mirror addresses from that same original's own
-- tasks/scheduler/sensors/lib/smartfuelfbl.lua (`mirror_sources`): 0x0600
-- for S.Port, 0x1014 for CRSF. (The original also has a `smartconsumption`
-- channel at the same appId as `consumption` -- not ported here since
-- nothing in this rebuild queries it yet; add it back if that changes.)
-- NOTE: still not independently verified live against real hardware.

-- Per-protocol candidate tables live in their own files (lib/telemetry_
-- sensors_sport.lua / _crsf.lua / _sim.lua) instead of one CANDIDATES
-- literal with all three built in, so only the protocol actually active
-- this session gets loadfile()'d -- tasks/msp/transport_select.lua picks
-- "sport" or "crsf" once at background-task init (no dynamic re-selection),
-- and tasks/session.lua substitutes "sim" for the whole session in the
-- Ethos simulator, so in practice exactly one (occasionally two, see below)
-- of these three ever loads per run, not all three unconditionally.
