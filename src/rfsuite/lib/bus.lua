-- Minimal publish/subscribe message bus.
--
-- This is the ONLY channel the system tool, dashboard widget, and background
-- task are allowed to use to talk to each other. None of them may reach into
-- another subsystem's tables directly, and none of them may stash state on a
-- shared global.
--
-- Every subsystem loads this file the same way:
--   local bus = assert(loadfile("lib/bus.lua"))()
-- `loadfile` alone would produce a *new*, independent chunk (and therefore a
-- new, disconnected bus) on every call, since each subsystem is loaded from
-- its own separate file. To keep a single shared instance without resorting
-- to an ad hoc global, this module caches itself once under a namespaced key
-- in Lua's own module registry (`package.loaded`) -- the same mechanism
-- `require()` uses internally. That key holds exactly one thing: this bus
-- table. It is not a place to accumulate unrelated shared state.
--
-- Only selected topics are retained and replayed to new subscribers.
-- "session.update" is retained because late-opening widgets/pages need the
-- current connection/profile snapshot even if the aircraft is idle.
-- "task.status" is retained so the app can tell whether the background task
-- has ever run before it lets pilots open MSP-backed pages. Transient command
-- topics such as "msp.request" must NOT be retained: those payloads carry
-- per-page callback closures, and retaining the last one would keep a closed
-- page alive after navigation.
