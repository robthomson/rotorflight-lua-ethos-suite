-- Shared "profile-scoped MSP editor page" machinery.
--
-- Extracted after app/pages/pids.lua and app/pages/pid_controller.lua
-- were built as near-verbatim hand copies of the identical pattern --
-- deliberately, so the actually-shared shape would come from two real
-- examples instead of being guessed at from one (see AGENTS.md's "Shared
-- page machinery" note for that reasoning). What follows is the distilled
-- result: several of these behaviors only exist because a live device
-- exposed a real bug in an earlier, simpler version -- see each method's
-- comment for the specific story rather than re-deriving it from scratch.
--
-- Owns: the loading/saving dialog (a nil-safe form.openProgressDialog
-- wrapper -- form.openProgressDialog() can return nil, which used to
-- crash), busy-state on the header's Save/Reload buttons, the full
-- load/save/reload/confirm cycle, the profile-switch-triggered
-- auto-reload (deferred to the page's own wakeup tick, since
-- form.openProgressDialog() only works reliably called from there, not
-- from a bus-subscriber callback nested inside the background task's own
-- wakeup), and long-press-ENTER-to-save (also deferred to that same
-- wakeup tick, and ordered so system.killEvents(KEY_ENTER_BREAK) has a
-- full cycle to take effect before any confirmation dialog exists to
-- receive a stray keypress).
--
-- Does NOT own: the field list, the row/grid layout, or which MSP codec
-- module is used -- those stay page-specific. A page using this:
--   1. local runtime = pageRuntime.new({...})
--   2. runtime:buildChrome()                    -- header, events, wakeup, bus
--   3. build its own fields against runtime.data[key], calling
--      runtime:registerField(key, widget) for each
--   4. runtime:loadInitial()
--
-- Self-caches via package.loaded (same mechanism lib/bus.lua uses) --
-- every one of the nine pages reloads this ~500-line file fresh via
-- loadfile() on every single open, but PageRuntime itself is just a
-- class table (methods only); all real state lives in the fresh instance
-- PageRuntime.new() returns each call, so re-parsing/re-executing this
-- whole chunk on every navigation was pure waste with no correctness
-- benefit. Added after a live memory investigation confirmed the *bulk*
-- of this rebuild's observed RAM growth is an Ethos platform trait (the
-- `form` widget system itself retaining something per created button/
-- field, outside Lua's own GC reachability -- confirmed by checking that
-- rotorflight-lua-ethos-suite shows the same symptom under the same
-- rebuild-every-navigation pattern) that no script-side change can
-- eliminate -- but redundant reloading of a whole 500-line stateless
-- module on every page open is a separate, real, avoidable cost this
-- rebuild's own code controls. See AGENTS.md's "Memory stats printing"
-- section for the full trace.
