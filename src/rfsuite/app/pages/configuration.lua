-- Configuration page. Loaded on demand (plain loadfile) only when the
-- user opens Configuration -> Setup -> Configuration -- see app/tool.lua.
-- First real page under Setup (every tile there besides this one is
-- still a scaffolded empty placeholder -- see app/tool.lua's own
-- comment on ROOT_ENTRIES).
--
-- Matches the original suite's own app/modules/configuration/
-- configuration.lua field selection: craft name, PID loop speed, and
-- three feature toggles (GPS, LED Strip, CMS) -- a small slice of a
-- 4-MSP-command page (NAME, ADVANCED_CONFIG, FEATURE_CONFIG, STATUS),
-- matching that suite's own openPage()/startLoad(), which reads exactly
-- those same four.
--
-- Multi-source (app/page_runtime.lua's `sources`, not `mspModule`) --
-- four independent commands combined onto one page, same precedent as
-- app/pages/tail_rotor.lua. `status` is genuinely **read-only**
-- (MSP_STATUS has no MSP_SET_STATUS in firmware at all -- confirmed
-- against rotorflight-firmware's own src/main/msp/msp.c) -- its
-- lib/msp_status.lua simply has no buildWriteMessage, and
-- app/page_runtime.lua's performSave() now skips writing any source
-- whose mspModule doesn't define one, rather than needing a separate
-- read-only-source config flag. STATUS's own field, task_delta_time_gyro
-- (the live gyro loop period), only feeds the PID loop speed field's own
-- display labels below -- it's never itself shown or edited.
--
-- `profileField = "none"` -- deliberately not "pidProfile" (the shared
-- default): Configuration has nothing to do with the FC's PID/rate
-- profile slots, so the profile-switch-auto-reload/title-suffix
-- machinery every other page gets from app/page_runtime.lua would be
-- pure noise here (worse, a spurious profile-triggered reload could
-- discard an in-progress edit for a reason this page has nothing to do
-- with). "none" is simply a session.update field key that will never
-- exist in the payload tasks/session.lua publishes, so `self.lastProfile`
-- always stays nil and that whole mechanism is permanently inert --
-- reusing the existing generic knob rather than adding a new
-- "disable this" flag to app/page_runtime.lua for a single page.
--
-- `rebootAfterSave = true` -- a PID loop speed change only takes effect
-- after the FC restarts, matching the original's own rebootFc() (called
-- right after its own save's EEPROM_WRITE completes). See
-- app/page_runtime.lua's own config comment and lib/msp_reboot.lua's for
-- the armed-state safety gate on that (skips just the reboot, not the
-- rest of the save, if `tasks/session.lua`'s isArmed is true when the
-- EEPROM write acks).
--
-- **All fields are built once, from onLoaded, not upfront in open()** --
-- the one page in this rebuild that deviates from every other page's
-- "build fields immediately, refresh their values once data arrives"
-- convention, and deliberately so. Craft Name is a plain text field
-- (form.addTextField) -- confirmed against Ethos's own Lua API
-- reference (classTextEdit-members.html) that the object it returns has
-- exactly 3 methods (enable/focus/rect), no `:value()` or equivalent at
-- all, unlike static text/number/choice fields. So unlike
-- app/pages/rates.lua's fields (correctable in place via :value()/
-- :minimum()/:decimals()/:values() once real data arrives), a text
-- field's displayed value genuinely cannot be corrected after
-- construction -- unrecoverable if built before the real craft name is
-- known. **Self-caught crash, found live**: an earlier version of this
-- page built the text field upfront (like every other page) and tried
-- `nameField:value(...)` from onLoaded to correct it once loaded, same
-- idiom as rates.lua -- Ethos's own error log showed "method 'value' is
-- not callable (a nil value)" the instant that ran.
--
-- The original suite's own configuration.lua already avoids this
-- entirely, for exactly this reason: its render() (building every field,
-- including its own addTextField call) never runs until state.loaded is
-- true, called from the tool's own wakeup() -- nothing is built at all
-- while state.loading. This page now does the same: all 5 fields (name,
-- PID loop speed, GPS, LED Strip, CMS) are built together from a single
-- buildFields(), wired through onLoaded (guarded so a later manual
-- Reload firing onLoaded again doesn't try to build a second copy of
-- everything on top of the first) -- which itself is safely deferred to
-- the app tool's own wakeup tick via app/page_runtime.lua's
-- pendingOnLoaded (added for app/pages/rates.lua's own onLoaded uses,
-- see that file's comment) -- the same context the original's own
-- render() already relies on for building fields successfully. Building
-- PID loop speed's real choice list directly at that point (the real
-- gyro rate and current denom are already known) also means it no
-- longer needs rates.lua's own "guess now, correct via :values() later"
-- two-step -- there's nothing to correct, since nothing was built with a
-- guess in the first place.
--
-- Tradeoff vs. every other page: buildFields() only runs on the *first*
-- successful load. A manual Reload firing onLoaded again is a no-op here
-- (the guard), so already-built fields just refresh their own values
-- normally (confirmed working for number/choice fields elsewhere in this
-- rebuild); only PID loop speed's option *labels* (built from whatever
-- gyro rate the first load saw) could go stale if the live gyro rate
-- somehow changed between then and a later reload -- gyro rate
-- essentially never changes mid-session, so this is an accepted,
-- extremely unlikely edge case, not a real gap.
--
-- GPS/LED Strip/CMS reuse app/field_layout.lua's existing `bit` spec
-- (app/pages/governor_flags.lua's own convention, promoted there for
-- exactly this kind of reuse) against `featureConfig.enabledFeatures`,
-- a packed U32 -- bit positions (7/16/19) confirmed against
-- rotorflight-lua-ethos-suite's own FEATURE_CONFIG.lua FEATURES_BITMAP.
-- fieldLayout.buildSingle() doesn't return the field it builds, so
-- re-enabling all 5 fields after this deferred build (loadData()'s own
-- "enable every registered field" loop already ran once, before any of
-- these existed) iterates `runtime.fields` directly rather than
-- threading each field reference back out -- see buildFields()'s own
-- comment.
--
-- Everything else -- dialog/busy/save/reload/confirm state, long-press-
-- save -- comes from app/page_runtime.lua, shared with every page.
