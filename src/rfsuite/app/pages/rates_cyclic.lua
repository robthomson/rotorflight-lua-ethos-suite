-- Cyclic Behaviour editor page. Loaded on demand (plain loadfile) only
-- when the user opens Flight Tuning -> Advanced -> Rates Advanced ->
-- Cyclic Behaviour -- see app/tool.lua.
--
-- Matches the original suite's own app/modules/rates_advanced/tools/
-- cyclic_behaviour.lua field selection: `cyclic_polarity` (On/Off) and
-- `cyclic_ring` (%), both on MSP_RC_TUNING (cmd 111/204, see
-- lib/msp_rc_tuning.lua) -- same command as app/pages/rates.lua/
-- rates_advanced.lua, a different field subset.
--
-- Hand-built rather than going through app/field_layout.lua (like
-- app/pages/pids.lua/rates.lua's own grids) because the two fields have
-- a real cross-field relationship the original implements and this
-- rebuild has no generic primitive for yet: toggling `cyclic_polarity`
-- on/off enables/disables the `cyclic_ring` field and resets its value
-- (0 when turned off; a sensible non-zero default when turned back on
-- from 0) -- matching the original's own handleCyclicRingToggle().
--
-- Deliberately simplified vs. the original in one direction only: the
-- original's own syncCyclicRingState() keeps this relationship
-- bidirectional (typing a nonzero value directly into the ring field
-- also flips the polarity toggle on). This page only handles
-- toggle -> ring (the primary interaction this page exists for); typing
-- into the ring field while polarity is off is simply not possible,
-- since the field is disabled in that state -- so the missing direction
-- has no way to matter in practice, it's not a real behavioral gap.
--
-- Everything else -- dialog/busy/save/reload/confirm state, long-press-
-- save, profile-switch-reload -- comes from app/page_runtime.lua, shared
-- with every page.
