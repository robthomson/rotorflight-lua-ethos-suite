-- Governor "Flags" profile editor page. Loaded on demand (plain loadfile) only when the user opens Flight Tuning ->
-- Governor -> Flags -- see app/tool.lua.
--
-- Edits four individual bits of MSP_GOVERNOR_PROFILE's `governor_flags`
-- (a packed U16, cmd 148/149, see lib/msp_governor_profile.lua) as
-- separate Off/On choice fields -- matching the original suite's own
-- app/modules/profile_governor/tools/flags.lua, which exposes the same
-- four bits (of ~10 defined ones) via its `apikey = "governor_flags->
-- fallback_precomp"` bitfield syntax. Bit positions cross-checked
-- against rotorflight-firmware's actual bitmap ordering (also visible in
-- the original's own app/modules/profile_governor/tools/general.lua,
-- which decodes the same field locally for its own enable-rule logic):
-- bit2=fallback_precomp, bit3=voltage_comp, bit4=pid_spoolup,
-- bit6=dyn_min_throttle. The other ~6 defined bits (fc_throttle_curve,
-- tx_precomp_curve, hs_adjustment, autorotation, suspend, bypass) are
-- wire-present and round-tripped like every other field this page
-- doesn't touch, but the original doesn't expose them on this page
-- either, so neither does this one.
--
-- First page using app/field_layout.lua's `bit` spec (see its own
-- comment for the arithmetic get/set) -- promoted there instead of kept
-- local specifically because a future page exposing more of this same
-- bitmap, or a different packed field entirely, should reuse it rather
-- than reinventing bit arithmetic per page.
--
-- Deliberately simplified vs. the original, same as app/pages/
-- governor_general.lua: no conditional enable/disable based on governor
-- mode or (for `voltage_comp` specifically) whether the battery's
-- voltage source is ADC-based -- this rebuild has neither governor-mode
-- nor battery-voltage-source telemetry tracked yet. Every field here is
-- simply always editable.
--
-- Everything else -- dialog/busy/save/reload/confirm state, long-press-
-- save, profile-switch-reload -- comes from app/page_runtime.lua, shared
-- with every page.
