ELRS telemetry slot to SID lookup.
Maps telemetry-config slot IDs to one or more ELRS SIDs.
Used by `elrs.lua` to compute the active SID set for runtime pruning.

Update process:
1. Keep slot IDs aligned with FC telemetry config ordering.
2. Keep SIDs aligned with definitions in `elrs_sensors.lua`.
3. Use numeric hex constants (`0xNNNN`) to avoid string conversions at runtime.
4. For aggregate slots, include all child SIDs needed by runtime consumers.
