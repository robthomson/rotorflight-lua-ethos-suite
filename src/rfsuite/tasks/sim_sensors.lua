-- Ethos-simulator-only sim sensors: fabricates DIY telemetry sensors for the
-- sim/sensors/*.lua keys, so the whole app (dashboards, telemetry pages,
-- tasks/session.lua's own sensor lookups via lib/telemetry_sensors.lua's
-- "sim" candidates) has something to read inside the Ethos simulator, the
-- same as it would off real MSP/telemetry hardware. Loaded (loadfile'd) and
-- scheduled by tasks/background.lua only when
-- system.getVersion().simulation == true -- never touched otherwise, so
-- real hardware pays zero cost for this file existing.
--
-- Mirrors rotorflight-lua-ethos-suite's tasks/scheduler/sensors/sim.lua,
-- trimmed hard:
--   - One lib/diy_sensor.lua instance per sensor instead of a bespoke
--     sensors.uid/lastvalue/lastupdate table -- that primitive already does
--     create-once + skip-unchanged + stale-refresh (same simplification
--     tasks/elrs_sensors.lua already made for its own per-SID sensors).
--   - No dropAutoDiscoveredSensors sweep: that existed to clear generic
--     telemetry-derived sensor sources Ethos's simulator can auto-populate
--     at *real* appId ranges (RSSI, voltage, etc.) that could otherwise
--     collide with auto-discovery. These sensors all live at
--     0x5001-0x5027, a range nothing else in this suite or Ethos itself
--     ever populates, so there is nothing to drop.
--   - appId/unit/decimals/range values copied straight from that original's
--     tasks/scheduler/telemetry/sources/sim.lua (uid/unit/dec/min/max
--     fields) -- kept identical so the appIds line up with
--     lib/telemetry_sensors.lua's own "sim" candidates table.
--
-- Each sensor's *value* comes from sim/sensors/<key>.lua, a `return <n>`
-- script the bin/sensors/ desktop editor overwrites -- re-read every
-- wakeup (not cached) so edits made there show up live without a script
-- reload.
